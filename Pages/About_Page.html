           <h3>The Aim Of Our Site:</h3>
  
           <p>The aim of our site is to join IT students together in order to be able to collaborate with each other 
              for cool projects, share knowledge with each other(through teaching each other skills i.e. coding) and
           create fun competitions (i.e. hackathons) for all of us who are part of the club to try out and test our skills,
           in as well. We hope you come to like our community if you are a coder or are interested in coding like us
              and that you find a home amongst your peers in IT within the club.
          </p>
